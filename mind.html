      <h1>STILLNESS</h1>
      <p>
        Allow yourself to find a posture where your head, neck and torso are in
        alignment.Through this posture you'll allow your body to be at a still
        point where a sense of physical stillness sets in.This will not only
        help steady your body but also your mind.
      </p>

      <h1>RELAXED AND EFFORTLESS</h1>
      <p>
        Be aware of your flow of breathe.By breathing you can feel it flow
        through your abdomen and sides of your rib cage as you breath in and
        out.This becomes a calm and natural state, for a long period of time it
        will deepen and become more smooth.Through this state all thoughts
        become irrelevant and you'll be in a zen state.

        your mind.
